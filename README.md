# 🧠 Olist Analytics Project  
**An end-to-end Data Analytics pipeline built using Python, MySQL, and Power BI.**  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **real-world analytics workflow**  from raw e-commerce data to business insights.  
I use the **Olist Brazilian E-commerce dataset**, which includes customer orders, products, reviews, payments, and sellers.

The goal is to design an **end-to-end data pipeline** that extracts, transforms, loads, and analyzes real data for decision-making.
